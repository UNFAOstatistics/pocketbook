## Title: This script computes the China 357 and China 351 aggregates
## Updated: 16/07/2014
## Notes: China (China mainland + Taiwan) (faostat country code = 357) and 
## China (China mainland + Taiwan + Macao + Hong Kong) (faostat country 
## code = 351) have to be treated as special aggregates. In theory, data
## in a dataset whould be mutually exclusive. This means for example that 
## ex USSR and countries that were born after USSR should not overlap in 
## terms of years and values. China is a special case because different 
## organizations use different aggregation levels to indicate China. For
## some organizations China corresponds to China mainland, for some others
## China corresponds to China mainland + Taiwan, or even China + Taiwan +
## Macao + Hong Kong. In the faostat country coding system, the first China
## has faostat code = 41, the second one = to 357, the third one = 351. The 
## purpose of this script is to compute the China 357 and China 351 aggregates
## avoiding double counting and keeping all the low levels entities 
## (China mainland, Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong).

# Remove duplicates for China 357 -----------------------------------------

## We do the computations in a subset of the main dataset because we do not
## want to loose any information. As a matter of fact, the "overlap" 
## function would set to NA the overlapping countries, but we want to keep
## China 41 and Taiwan in the main dataset.
china357.df <- country.df[country.df[, "FAOST_CODE"] %in% c(357,41,214),]
## This is a trick. We use the overlap function to spot duplicates for China.
## In case of duplicates, if we select take = "takeOld" we prioritize 
## the already aggregated China 357, while if we select take = "takeNew" we
## prioritize the aggregate China 357 that will be computed in the next
## step. The option take = "complete" prioritize the aggregate China 357
## computed by us but only if both China 41 and Taiwan are available.

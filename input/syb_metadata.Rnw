\begin{metadata}{Agricultural production indices} {}
The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. All the indices are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities – except for fish – of each commodity – except for fish – are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. The fish index is only normalized to the base period 2004-06.Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. When calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. International commodity prices are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates and to improve international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These ”international prices”, expressed in ”international dollars,” are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients, although it does not include fish. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers or in their average live weight are not taken into account.

\begin{metadata}{Agriculture orientation index (AOI)} {}
Measures the ratio of the agriculture share of government expenditures, over the agriculture contribution to the economy. An AOI greater than 1 gives more prominence to agriculture than its contribution to the economy, as measured by GDP, while those with an AOI less than 1 give more prominence to non-agricultural sectors.

\begin{metadata}{Agriculture value added per worker} {}
Agriculture comprises value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Data are in constant 2000 U.S. dollars. Agricultural productivity is measured by value added per unit of input. Agricultural value added includes that from forestry and fishing. Data on employment are drawn from labor force surveys, household surveys, official estimates, censuses and administrative records of social insurance schemes, and establishment surveys when no other information is available. The concept of employment generally refers to people above a certain age who worked, or who held a job, during a reference period. Employment data include both full-time and part-time workers.

\begin{metadata}{Aquaculture fish production} {}
Defined as the farming of aquatic organisms. Farmingimplies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries. In the case of capture-based aquaculture, only the incremental growth (or weight gain) in captivity, could and should be reported as the production from aquaculture. Data included here covers an aquaculture production of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and miscellaneous aquatic animals but excluding production for marine mammals, crocodiles, corals, pearls, sponges and aquatic plants. Fish production is the sum of aquaculture and capture fish production.

\begin{metadata}{Crop production} {}
Refer to the actual harvested production from the field or orchard and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and that part of crop not harvested for any reason. Production therefore includes the quantities of the commodity sold in the market (marketed production) and the quantities consumed or used by the producers (auto-consumption). When the production data available refers to a production period falling into two successive calendar years and it is not possible to allocate the relative production to each of them, it is usual to refer production data to that year into which the bulk of the production falls. Crop production data are recorded in tonnes (t). In many countries, crop production data are obtained as a function of the estimated yield and the total area. If such a compilation method of production statistics is enforced by the country, it must be ensured that the total area does not refer to sown or planted area, which would give then the biological production, but to the actually harvested area during the year.

\begin{metadata}{Domestic food price level index} {}
An indicator of the relative price of food in a country. The indicator is calculated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) data from the World Bank as well as general and food consumer price indices from the International Labour Organization made consistent and available on FAOSTAT.  Specifically, the ratio of food and non-alcoholic beverages expenditure to actual individual consumption is calculated in purchasing power parity terms relative to  the United States. To control for inflation, this ratio is forecasted and backcasted using the ratio of a country's Food Consumer Price Index (FPI) and General Consumer Price Index (CPI) using a 2011 base year, relative to the United States. The indicator is computed for countries for which International Comparison Program data as well as general and food consumer price indices are available.

\begin{metadata}{Domestic food price volatility} {}
Measures the variability in the relative price of food in a country.  The indicator is calculated from the monthly domestic food price level index using monthly consumer and general food price indices and purchasing power parity data from the International Comparison Program conducted by the World Bank (see the Relative Price of Food Indicator for more information).  Month-to-month growth rates are calculated, and the standard deviation of these growth rates are calculated over the previous 8 months (8-months rolling standard deviation).  The average of these standard deviations is then computed to obtain an annual volatility indicator.

Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1-5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 3.

\begin{metadata}{Wheat} {}
Triticum spp.: common (T. aestivum) durum (T. durum) spelt (T. spelta). Common and durum wheat are the main types. Among common wheat, the main varieties are spring and winter, hard and soft, and red and white. At the national level, different varieties should be reported separately, reflecting their different uses. Used mainly for human food.

\begin{metadata}{Wood pellet production (thousand tonnes)} {}
The most common type of pellet fuel and are generally made from compacted sawdust and related industrial wastes from the milling of lumber, manufacture of wood products and furniture, and construction. Other industrial waste sources include Empty Fruit Bunches [EFB], palm kernel shells, coconut shells, and tree tops and branches discarded during logging operations.

\footnotesize
The country classification adopted in this publication is based on the United Nations M49 classification \\* (\url{http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm}). The country names have been abbreviated for the purpose of this publication. The official FAO names can be found at \url{http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/}.

Following the creation of the Republic of South Sudan in July 2011, the M49 classification considered the Sudan as part of the Northern Africa region, and South Sudan as part of Eastern Africa. In this report, data for the Sudan are therefore included in the Northern Africa region.

The asterisk in charts and maps indicates the most recent year available in the specified time interval. In the country profiles, when the country data have not been reported for the reference year, data in italics indicate that the value for the most recent year available is shown.

In the tables, a blank means not applicable or, for an aggregate, not analytically meaningful. A 0 or 0.0 means zero or a number that is small enough to round to zero at the displayed number of decimal places.

The \textasciitilde{} in the maps refers to the range specified in the class intervals.

In addition:
\begin{itemize}
\item <5.0 proportion less than 5 percent
\item <0.1 less than 100\,000 people
\item ns not statistically significant 
\end{itemize}

Two types of aggregations are used in the book: sum and weighted mean. Two restrictions are imposed when computing the aggregation: i) the sufficiency condition – the aggregation is computed only when sufficient countries have reported data, and the current threshold is set at 50 percent of the variable and the weighting variable, if present; and ii) the comparability condition – as aggregations are usually computed over time, this condition is designed to ensure that the number of countries is comparable over several years; under the current restriction the number of countries may not vary by more than 15 over time.

This publication was carried out under the direction of Pietro Gennari (Chief Statistician and Director, ESS) . It was prepared by the Statistics Division (Amy Heyman and Markus Kainu). A special thanks the team leaders for their input and to Nicola Selleri (ESS) for the cover design.

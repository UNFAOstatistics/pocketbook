FS.OU.VAD.PCT,Prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency (%),Prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency,,percent,"Retinol is the predominant circulating form of vitamin A in the blood. In response to tissue demand, it is released from the liver in a 1:1 ratio with its carrier protein, retinol-binding protein. In the blood, this complex combines with transthyretin. Specific receptors on target cell surfaces or nuclei bind this complex or its active metabolites, thereby regulating many critical functions in the body, including vision, epithelial tissue integrity, and the expression of several hundred genes. Serum retinol levels reflect liver vitamin A stores only when they are severely depleted (< 0.07 ?mol/g liver) or extremely high (> 1.05 ?mol/g liver). Between these extremes, serum retinol is homeostatically controlled and thus not always correlated with vitamin A intake or clinical signs of deficiency. Consequently, serum retinol is not useful for assessing the vitamin A status of individuals and may not respond to interventions. Rather, the distribution of serum retinol values in a population and the prevalence of individuals with serum retinol values below a given cut-off can provide important information on the vitamin A status of a population and may reflect the severity of vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem, especially when the degree of underlying infection or inflammation is taken into account. Serum retinol values are most often measured in young children, a group highly vulnerable to deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin A is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from common childhood infections and is the worldï¾’s leading preventable cause of childhood blindness. The cut-off values for public health significance is 20%.

FS.OU.IODINE.PCT,Prevalence of Iodine deficiency (%),Prevalence of Iodine deficiency,,percent,"An estimated 35% of the worldï¾’s population has insufficient iodine intake and continues to live at risk of iodine deficiency and associated disorders. Iodine deficiency poses a threat throughout the lifecycle and has been associated with mental impairment and goitre in older children and adults, and complications with pregnancy, including stillbirth and congenital anomalies. Inadequate iodine intake during pregnancy may lead to irreversible fetal brain damage. Urinary iodine is a well-accepted, cost-efficient and easily obtainable indicator for iodine status. Since the majority of iodine absorbed by the body is excreted in the urine, it is considered a sensitive marker of current iodine intake and can reflect recent changes in iodine status. However, this indicator does not provide direct information about thyroid function. Although an individualï¾’s urinary iodine concentration can vary daily, or even within the same day, these variations tend to even out within populations, providing a useful measure of the iodine status of populations. The cut-off values for public health significance is 20%.

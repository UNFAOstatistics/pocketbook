agricultural_production_indices,Agricultural production indices,"The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. All the indices are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities – except for fish – of each commodity – except for fish – are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. The fish index is only normalized to the base period 2004-06.Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. When calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. International commodity prices are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates and to improve international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These ”international prices”, expressed in ”international dollars,” are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients, although it does not include fish. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers or in their average live weight are not taken into account.","FAO, Statistics Division and Fisheries Division",FAO
agriculture_orientation_index,Agriculture orientation index (AOI),"Measures the ratio of the agriculture share of government expenditures, over the agriculture contribution to the economy. An AOI greater than 1 gives more prominence to agriculture than its contribution to the economy, as measured by GDP, while those with an AOI less than 1 give more prominence to non-agricultural sectors.","FAO, Statistics Division",FAO
Agriculture value added per worker,Agriculture value added per worker,"Agriculture comprises value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Data are in constant 2000 U.S. dollars. Agricultural productivity is measured by value added per unit of input. Agricultural value added includes that from forestry and fishing. Data on employment are drawn from labor force surveys, household surveys, official estimates, censuses and administrative records of social insurance schemes, and establishment surveys when no other information is available. The concept of employment generally refers to people above a certain age who worked, or who held a job, during a reference period.

Aquaculture fish production,Aquaculture fish production,"Defined as the farming of aquatic organisms. Farmingimplies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries. In the case of capture-based aquaculture, only the incremental growth (or weight gain) in captivity, could and should be reported as the production from aquaculture. Data included here covers an aquaculture production of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and miscellaneous aquatic animals but excluding production for marine mammals, crocodiles, corals, pearls, sponges and aquatic plants. Fish production is the sum of aquaculture and capture fish production.",Fisheries and Aquaculture Department (Fishery and Aquaculture statistics),FAO

Crop production,Crop production,"Refer to the actual harvested production from the field or orchard and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and that part of crop not harvested for any reason. Production therefore includes the quantities of the commodity sold in the market (marketed production) and the quantities consumed or used by the producers (auto-consumption). When the production data available refers to a production period falling into two successive calendar years and it is not possible to allocate the relative production to each of them, it is usual to refer production data to that year into which the bulk of the production falls. Crop production data are recorded in tonnes (t). In many countries, crop production data are obtained as a function of the estimated yield and the total area. If such a compilation method of production statistics is enforced by the country, it must be ensured that the total area does not refer to sown or planted area, which would give then the biological production, but to the actually harvested area during the year.","FAO, Statistics Division",FAO

The indicator is calculated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) data from the World Bank as well as general and food consumer price indices from the International Labour Organization made consistent and available on FAOSTAT.  Specifically, the ratio of food and non-alcoholic beverages expenditure to actual individual consumption is calculated in purchasing power parity terms relative to  the United States. To control for inflation, this ratio is forecasted and backcasted using the ratio of a country's Food Consumer Price Index (FPI) and General Consumer Price Index (CPI) using a 2011 base year, relative to the United States. The indicator is computed for countries for which International Comparison Program data as well as general and food consumer price indices are available.","FAO, Statistics Division",ILO and World Bank
Domestic food price volatility,Domestic food price volatility,"Measures the variability in the relative price of food in a country.  The indicator is calculated from the monthly domestic food price level index using monthly consumer and general food price indices and purchasing power parity data from the International Comparison Program conducted by the World Bank (see the Relative Price of Food Indicator for more information).  Month-to-month growth rates are calculated, and the standard deviation of these growth rates are calculated over the previous 8 months (8-months rolling standard deviation).  The average of these standard deviations is then computed to obtain an annual volatility indicator.","FAO, Statistics Division","FAO, ILO and World Bank"

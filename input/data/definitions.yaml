  description: Agriculture comprises value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing

    of input. Agricultural value added includes that from forestry and fishing. Data
    on employment are drawn from labor force surveys, household surveys, official
    estimates, censuses and administrative records of social insurance schemes, and
    establishment surveys when no other information is available. The concept of employment
    generally refers to people above a certain age who worked, or who held a job,
    during a reference period. Employment data include both full-time and part-time
    workers.

    aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource,

    share of food expenditures is defined in the sources of data, this indicator captures
    the monetary value of food obtained from all the possible food sources (purchases,

    of purchased food. Total consumption expenditures include both food and non-food
    expenditures, and exclude non-consumption expenditures such as taxes, insurances,

  name: Production, crops
  description: Refer to the actual harvested production from the field or orchard
    and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and that part of crop not
    harvested for any reason. Production therefore includes the quantities of the
    commodity sold in the market (marketed production) and the quantities consumed
    or used by the producers (auto-consumption). When the production data available
    refers to a production period falling into two successive calendar years and it
    is not possible to allocate the relative production to each of them, it is usual
    to refer production data to that year into which the bulk of the production falls.
    Crop production data are recorded in tonnes (t). In many countries, crop production
    data are obtained as a function of the estimated yield and the total area. If
    such a compilation method of production statistics is enforced by the country,
    it must be ensured that the total area does not refer to sown or planted area,
    which would give then the biological production, but to the actually harvested
    area during the year.

    of permanent crops. Net area differs from gross area insofar as the latter includes
    uncultivated patches, footpaths, ditches, headlands, shoulders, shelterbelts,
    etc. If the crop under consideration is harvested more than once during the year
    as a consequence of successive cropping (i.e. the same crop is sown or planted
    more than once in the same field during the year), the area is counted as many
    times as harvested

  name: Agricultural production indices
  description: The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level
    of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison
    with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities
    of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities
    used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. All the indices are calculated
    by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities – except for fish – of each commodity
    – except for fish – are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity
    prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given
    year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. The fish
    index is only normalized to the base period 2004-06.Since the FAO indices are
    based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and
    feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once
    in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.
    Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and
    poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They
    cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize,
    potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes,
    meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all
    stages. When calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production,
    all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However,
    for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within
    the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops”
    and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and
    seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs)
    are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups,
    namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.
    International commodity prices are used in order to avoid the use of exchange
    rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates and to improve international
    comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These ”international
    prices”, expressed in ”international dollars,” are derived using a Geary-Khamis
    formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each
    commodity. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural
    production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. The
    category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and
    that contain nutrients, although it does not include fish. Accordingly, coffee
    and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible,
    they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed
    based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the
    meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported
    live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers
    or in their average live weight are not taken into account.

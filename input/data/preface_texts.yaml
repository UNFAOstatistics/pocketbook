  foreword: |
    The objective of the FAO Regional Office for Africa (RAF) is to 
    improve sustainable nutrition and food security in the African 
    continent. To realize this vision, RAF focuses its work on promoting 
    sustainable increases in agricultural production, enhancing sustainable 
    use and management of natural resources, supporting market access 
    and measures for better trade and promoting information and knowledge 
    management and sharing. The issue of better monitoring progress, 
    learning from experiences, best practices and improving further 
    activities is of great importance to RAF, and statistical data 
    constitute an important input.
    
    This is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community 
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium 
    Development Goals (MDGs). We are now taking stock of what we can 
    learn from that effort. 

    In Sub-Saharan Africa, the commitment to halve the percentage of hungry 
    people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target, was achieved by 18 
    countries – 5 from Eastern Africa, 8 from Western Africa, 4 from 
    Middle Africa and only 1 country in Middle Africa. Slower progress 
    was also made across the region towards meeting the more ambitious 
    WFS goal of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015; 
    only 7 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa reached this goal. At the 
    global level, 72 of the 129 countries monitored for progress have 
    reached that MDG target, while 29 of them also attained the WFS goal.

    This year also marks the beginning of the new post-2015 Sustainable 
    Development Agenda. Again, the international community will unite 
    around new priorities for the future. Clear indicators to measure 
    progress towards these international goals are of paramount importance. 
    Timely and robust statistics are the fundamental tool in monitoring 
    the myriad efforts being made, both with an eye to early detection 
    of problems and the recognition of success. The better the data, 
    the better the policies that can be designed. And the better the data, 
    the easier it is to measure the impact of policies or to hold 
    stakeholders accountable for the pledges they make.

    This publication presents selected key indicators related to
    agriculture and food security that stakeholders can use to
    prioritize their actions. It is divided into two main sections, one
    thematic and one country-specific. It presents a variety of
    dimensions of agriculture and food security along four main focus
    areas:

    {\textbf{\color{part1} The setting}} measures the state of the
    agricultural resource base by assessing the supply of land, labour,
    capital and inputs, and examining the pressure on the world food
    system stemming from demographic and macroeconomic change.

    {\textbf{\color{part2} Hunger dimensions}} gauges the state of
    food insecurity and malnutrition, and highlights the four dimensions
    – availability, access, stability and utilization – that determine
    the scale of hunger and the shape of undernourishment.

    {\textbf{\color{part3} Food supply}} evaluates the past and
    present productive capacity of world agriculture, together with the
    role of trade, in meeting the world’s demand for food, feed and
    other products.

    {\textbf{\color{part4} Environment}} examines the sustainability
    of agriculture in the context of the pressure it exerts on its
    ecological surroundings, including the interaction of agriculture
    with climate change.

    This Pocketbook is part of the FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of 
    products and is just one of the tools that can be used as building 
    blocks for monitoring progress and formulating policy. It includes 
    data from FAOSTAT as well as from other partners within the 
    organization and in the international community. FAO is deeply 
    committed to helping countries strengthen their statistical systems 
    to improve the timeliness and quality of their data. And it will 
    continue to do so through the Sustainable Development Goals’ process.

    This is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community 
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium Development

    For example, we know that the commitment to halve the percentage of hungry 
    people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target, has been almost met at the global 
    level. Indeed, 73 of the 129 countries monitored for progress have reached

  foreword: |
    This statistical pocket book comes out in a time when the international
    community is closing a page on the MDGs and is moving towards a new
    development challenge framed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
    and agreements reached on the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21)
    to the United Nations on the Climate Change. Several countries in the
    region face problems of conflicts and protracted crises which severely
    affect their food security situation. Nonetheless, many other countries
    in the region made significant progress in reducing hunger and food
    insecurity and improving the overall livelihoods of their populations.

    Any effort to measure the progress towards the achievements of the SDGs 
    and COP21 agreements has to be based on sound data and statistics. 
    This pocketbook publication like many other hard copies and electronic
    statistical publications will definitely contribute in building knowledge
    and information datasets for monitoring the socio-economic developments and
    changes overtime. And hence will help measure the regional progress towards 
    the agriculture related SD goals of hunger, climate change and sustainable
    consumption and production, and impacts of climate change.
    
    A wide range of interconnected issues challenge the region, 
    including dwindling water and land resources, the gap between food needs
    and food production, increasing difficulties in balancing employment and
    income generation as populations expand, investments decline in the rural
    sector, threats from environmental strain increase, natural and human-induced
    disasters, as well as the impacts of climate change.  As result of these issues,
    the predominance of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are very common 
    in the region. Currently, there are 33.7 million undernourished people in the
    Near East and North Africa. Most of these people live in rural areas and rely
    on agriculture for their livelihoods.  Meeting these challenges with 
    evidence-based policymaking will require timely statistical information from a 
    wide range of fields. As a contribution to this effort, the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
    the United Nations has prepared this Regional Pocketbook publication 
    for the Near East and North Africa.
    
    The information and data provided in this publication serves as a reference 
    for policymakers, donor agencies, researchers and analysts, and the general 
    public. But more importantly, the pocketbook offers background information 
    in monitoring the progress made in the three regional initiatives of water 
    scarcity, small scale agriculture, and resilience building which were 
    strategized to improve the food security and nutrition of the people in the 
    region.

    The Pocketbook contains information and data on food production, and natural 
    resources of land, water, energy and forestry. Other essential data on the 
    publication are those of economy, labour, input and investment. Also, the   
    pocketbook demonstrates FAO's effort in strengthening statistical products 
    and disseminating countries' data to be used as building blocks for 
    monitoring progress and formulating policies related to the development of 
    the RNE countries. It includes data from FAOSTAT as well as from other 
    partners within the organization and in the international community.
    
    FAO remains committed to working with partners and Member States in the 
    Near East and North Africa to improve agricultural and rural statistics 
    and facilitate the process of transforming this information into policies 
    that will strengthen food security in the region and ensure more sustainable 
    food production. 
    
    To this effect, RNE is in the middle of implementing the Action Plan (AP) 
    of the Global Strategy to improve agricultural and rural statistics. This 
    is part of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics, 
    a long-term project promoted by FAO and international partners. The regional 
    strategy and its AP is supported by the countries in the region and regional 
    stakeholders including the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for 
    Western Asia (ESCWA), and the Statistical, Economic and Social Research and 
    Training Centre for Islamic Countries (SESRIC), Islamic Development Bank, 
    Arab organization of Agricultural Development (AOAD).

  foreword: |
    Today, more people are consuming more coffee than ever before. As
    the middle classes of the developing world continue to swell, as
    their incomes rise and coffee remains affordable, the luxury of the
    occasional coffee has become a daily habit in an ever-growing number
    of countries. The rising demand has also afforded producers with new
    options and opportunities. Coffee has become an important
    contributor to cash income for many smallholders, who produce most
    of the world’s beans. The annual output has now reached almost nine
    million tonnes, one million tonnes more than a decade ago. The gross
    value of production of green coffee now exceeds US\$16 billion, and
    its export value reached US\$24 billion in 2012.

    \vspace{3mm}

    While rising demand offers unprecedented opportunities to growers,
    they also have to live up to a growing set of challenges. Many are
    confronted with inadequate access to credit, high price volatility,
    as well as bureaucratic hurdles at home and market barriers abroad.
    And, they are operating in a global value chain where a vast and
    often unorganized number of small coffee growers are exposed to the
    market power of a few, large traders and roasters. In addition, many
    smallholders find it hard to cope with the vagaries of weather in
    the short-run and the deteriorating growing conditions brought about
    by climate change over the longer-term.

    \vspace{3mm}

    This Pocketbook puts numbers to these developments, assesses short-
    term changes and long-term trends in production, consumption, trade
    and prices, and provides useful background information on related
    shifts in poverty, health and rural development. It is part of the
    FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of products and is organized around
    two major sections: thematic spreads with data-driven
    visualizations, and comprehensive country and regional profiles.

    \vspace{3mm}

    FAO is strongly committed to helping countries strengthen their
    national statistical systems and improve the timeliness and quality
    of their data. This includes a commitment to improve and broaden the
    information necessary to support evidence-based decision making by
    all stakeholders in the coffee value chain.

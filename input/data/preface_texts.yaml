    The objective of the FAO Regional Office for Africa (RAF) is to 
    improve sustainable nutrition and food security in the African 
    continent. To realize this vision, RAF focuses its work on promoting 
    sustainable increases in agricultural production, enhancing sustainable 
    use and management of natural resources, supporting market access 
    and measures for better trade and promoting information and knowledge 
    management and sharing. The issue of better monitoring progress, 
    learning from experiences, best practices and improving further 
    activities is of great importance to RAF, and statistical data 
    constitute an important input.
    
    This is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community 
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium Development 
    Goals (MDGs). We are now taking stock of what we can learn from that effort. 
    
    In Sub-Saharan Africa, the commitment to halve the percentage of hungry 
    people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target, was achieved by 18 
    countries – 5 from Eastern Africa, 8 from Western Africa, 4 from 
    Middle Africa and only 1 country in Middle Africa. Slower progress 
    was also made across the region towards meeting the more ambitious 
    WFS goal of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015; 
    only 7 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa reached this goal. At the 
    global level, 72 of the 129 countries monitored for progress have 
    reached that MDG target, while 29 of them also attained the WFS goal. 
    
    This year also marks the beginning of the new post-2015 Sustainable 
    Development Agenda. Again, the international community will unite 
    around new priorities for the future. Clear indicators to measure 
    progress towards these international goals are of paramount importance. 
    Timely and robust statistics are the fundamental tool in monitoring 
    the myriad efforts being made, both with an eye to early detection 
    of problems and the recognition of success. The better the data, 
    the better the policies that can be designed. And the better the data, 
    the easier it is to measure the impact of policies or to hold 
    stakeholders accountable for the pledges they make.

    This Pocketbook is part of the FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of
    products and is just one of the tools that can be used as building
    blocks for monitoring progress and formulating policy. It includes
    data from FAOSTAT as well as from other partners within the

    The present pocketbook appears at the crucial moment of the World Development Agenda.

    On one hand, this is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community 
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium Development Goals. 
    We are now taking stock of what we learned from that effort. The Europe and Central 
    Asia region (ECA) has achieved Millennium Development Goal 1C of halving the 
    percentage of hungry, with undernourishment at less than 5 percent in the region 
    since 2010-12, the lowest of all five FAO regions. All countries in the region 
    have made considerable progress in reducing the incidence of hunger, and all 
    except one have halved the incidence of hunger even before the 2015 deadline. 
    The ECA Region was also quite close to achieving the more ambitious World Food 
    Summit (WFS) goal of reducing by half the absolute number of people living in 
    hunger, a feat achieved by few countries. In the ECA region the total number 
    of hungry was reduced from 9.9 million to 5.9 million between 1990/92 and 2014/16. 
    This represents an achievement rate of about 80\%, far better than the 
    achievement rate in the world as a whole.

    On the other hand, this year also marks the beginning of the new post-2015 
    Sustainable Development Agenda. Again the international community will unite 
    around new priorities for the future. Clear indicators to measure progress 
    towards these international goals are of paramount importance. Timely and 
    robust statistics are the fundamental tool in monitoring the myriad 
    efforts being made, both with an eye to early detection of problems 
    and the recognition of success. The better the data, the better are the 
    policies that can be designed. And the better the data, the easier it is to 
    measure the impact of policies or to hold stakeholders accountable for the pledges they make.

    FAO is deeply committed to helping countries strengthen their statistical 
    systems to improve the timeliness and quality of their data. And it will 
    continue to do so through the Sustainable Development Goal’s process.

    Представленный вашему вниманию карманный справочник появляется на 
    решающем этапе повестки дня в области мирового развития.

    С одной стороны, это конец пятнадцатилетнего цикла, в рамках которого 
    международное сообщество в партнерстве с развивающимися странами пыталось 
    достичь Целей развития тысячелетия (ЦРТ). Сейчас мы подводим итоги. 
    Регион Европы и Центральной Азии (ЕЦА) достиг цели 1С по снижению 
    вдвое доли людей, страдающих от голода: в среднем с 2010-2012 гг. 
    численность недоедающего населения оценивается на уровне менее 5 процентов 
    от общей численности населения региона, что является самым низким показателем 
    среди всех пяти регионов ФАО. Все страны региона добились значительного 
    прогресса в сокращении масштабов голода, и во всех странах, за исключением одной, 
    вдвое сократилась доля голодающего населения даже до наступления 
    установленного срока - 2015 года. Регион ЕЦА был также довольно близок к 
    достижению более амбициозной цели, поставленной на Всемирном продовольственном 
    саммите (ВПС), по сокращению вдвое абсолютного числа голодающих; 
    эта цель была достигнута несколькими странами. 
    В период между 1990-92 и 2014-16 гг. общее число голодающих в регионе 
    ЕЦА сократилось с 9,9 млн до 5,9 млн. Таким образом, уровень достижения 
    цели составляет примерно 80 процентов, что гораздо выше, 
    чем уровень достижения в мире в целом. 

    С другой стороны, этот год также знаменует собой начало новой повестки дня в области 
    устойчивого развития на период после 2015 года. Международное сообщество вновь 
    объединяет свои усилия с целью достижения новых приоритетных задач в будущем. 
    Первостепенное значение имеет определение четких показателей для измерения прогресса 
    в достижении международных целей. Своевременная и надежная статистика является 
    основным инструментом мониторинга многочисленных усилий в этой области, с целью 
    раннего выявления проблем и признания успехов. Чем лучше качество статистических 
    данных, тем эффективнее политика, которая может быть разработана на их основе. 
    Чем лучше качество данных, тем легче оценить последствия политики или призвать 
    к ответственности заинтересованные стороны за взятые ими на себя обязательства. 

    ФАО стремится оказывать помощь странам в укреплении их статистических систем с целью повышения 
    оперативности и качества их данных. ФАО будет продолжать свою деятельность в этом направлении 
    в рамках процесса достижения целей устойчивого развития.

  foreword: |
    This statistical Pocketbook comes out at a time when the international
    community is closing a page on the MDGs, moving towards a new
    development challenge framed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
    and the agreements reached on the 21\textsuperscript{st} Conference
    of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations on the Climate Change.

    Any effort to measure the progress towards the achievements of the SDGs
    and COP21 agreements has to be based on sound data and statistics.
    This pocketbook publication is a repository of datasets on food security,
    nutrition agriculture and natural resources that can contribute,
    alongside other statistics, to measuring regional progresses towards
    the achievement of food security, nutrition, agriculture and natural
    resources related SD goals.

    The information and data provided in this publication are intended for
    policymakers, donor agencies, researchers and analysts, as well as
    the general public.

    The Pocketbook contains information and data on food production and 
    natural resources of land, water, energy and forestry. 
    Other essential data on the publication are those of economy, 
    labour, input and investment. Additionally, the pocketbook 
    demonstrates FAO’s effort in strengthening statistical products 
    and disseminating countries’ data to be used as building blocks 
    for monitoring progress and formulating policies related to the 
    development of the Near East and North Africa (NENA) countries. 
    It includes data from FAOSTAT as well as from other partners 
    within the organization and in the international community.

    FAO remains committed to working with partners and Member States 
    in the NENA to improve agricultural and rural statistics and 
    facilitate the process of transforming this information into 
    policies that can improve food security and nutrition situations 
    in the region and ensure sustainable food production.

    The Global Strategy to improve agricultural and rural statistics 
    launched by FAO and its partners is a vivid illustration of 
    this commitment. As part of the global strategy, a regional 
    strategy and an Action Plan - to improve agricultural and rural 
    statistics in the NENA will be implemented with the support of 
    the countries in the region and regional stakeholders, 
    including the United Nations Economic and Social Commission 
    for Western Asia (ESCWA), the Statistical, Economic and Social 
    Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries (SESRIC), 
    the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), and the Arab organization 
    of Agricultural Development (AOAD).

  subtitle: Coffee
  bottom_row1: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
  bottom_row2: Regional office for Africa

  foreword: |
    Today, more people are consuming more coffee than ever before. As
    the middle classes of the developing world continue to swell, as
    their incomes rise and coffee remains affordable, the luxury of the
    occasional coffee has become a daily habit in an ever-growing number
    of countries. The rising demand has also afforded producers with new
    options and opportunities. Coffee has become an important
    contributor to cash income for many smallholders, who produce most
    of the world’s beans. The annual output has now reached almost nine
    million tonnes, one million tonnes more than a decade ago. The gross
    value of production of green coffee now exceeds US\$16 billion, and
    its export value reached US\$24 billion in 2012.

    \vspace{3mm}

    While rising demand offers unprecedented opportunities to growers,
    they also have to live up to a growing set of challenges. Many are
    confronted with inadequate access to credit, high price volatility,
    as well as bureaucratic hurdles at home and market barriers abroad.
    And, they are operating in a global value chain where a vast and
    often unorganized number of small coffee growers are exposed to the
    market power of a few, large traders and roasters. In addition, many
    smallholders find it hard to cope with the vagaries of weather in
    the short-run and the deteriorating growing conditions brought about
    by climate change over the longer-term.

    \vspace{3mm}

    This Pocketbook puts numbers to these developments, assesses short-
    term changes and long-term trends in production, consumption, trade
    and prices, and provides useful background information on related
    shifts in poverty, health and rural development. It is part of the
    FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of products and is organized around
    two major sections: thematic spreads with data-driven
    visualizations, and comprehensive country and regional profiles.

    \vspace{3mm}

    FAO is strongly committed to helping countries strengthen their
    national statistical systems and improve the timeliness and quality
    of their data. This includes a commitment to improve and broaden the
    information necessary to support evidence-based decision making by
    all stakeholders in the coffee value chain.

    This is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium
    Development Goals. We are now taking stock of what we can learn from
    that effort. For example we know that the commitment to halve the
    percentage of hungry people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target,
    has been almost met at the global level. Indeed, 73 of the 129
    countries monitored for progress have reached that MDG target, while
    29 of them also reached the more ambitious WFS goal by at least
    halving the number of undernourished people in their populations.

    This year also marks the beginning of the new post-2015 Sustainable
    Development Agenda. Again the international community will unite
    around new priorities for the future.

    Clear indicators to measure progress towards these international
    goals is of paramount importance. Timely and robust statistics are
    the fundamental tool in monitoring the myriad efforts being made,
    both with an eye to early detection of problems and the recognition
    of success. The better the data, the better the policies that can be
    designed. And the better the data, the easier it is to measure the
    impact of policies or to hold stakeholders accountable for the
    pledges they make.

    This publication presents selected key indicators related to
    agriculture and food security that stakeholders can use to
    prioritize their actions. It is divided into two main sections, one
    thematic and one country-specific. It presents a variety of
    dimensions of agriculture and food security along four main focus
    areas:

    {\textbf{\color{part1} The setting}} measures the state of the
    agricultural resource base by assessing the supply of land, labour,
    capital and inputs, and examining the pressure on the world food
    system stemming from demographic and macroeconomic change.

    {\textbf{\color{part2} Hunger dimensions}} gauges the state of
    food insecurity and malnutrition, and highlights the four dimensions
    – availability, access, stability and utilization – that determine
    the scale of hunger and the shape of undernourishment.

    {\textbf{\color{part3} Food supply}} evaluates the past and
    present productive capacity of world agriculture, together with the
    role of trade, in meeting the world’s demand for food, feed and
    other products.

    {\textbf{\color{part4} Environment}} examines the sustainability
    of agriculture in the context of the pressure it exerts on its
    ecological surroundings, including the interaction of agriculture
    with climate change.

    This Pocketbook is part of the FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of
    products and is just one of the tools that can be used as building
    blocks for monitoring progress and formulating policy. It includes
    data from FAOSTAT as well as from other partners within the
    organization and in the international community.

    FAO is deeply committed to helping countries strengthen their
    statistical systems to improve the timeliness and quality of their
    data. And it will continue to do so through the SDG process.

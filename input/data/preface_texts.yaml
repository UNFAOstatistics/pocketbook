    This is the end of a 15-year cycle where the international community
    partnered with developing countries to tackle the Millennium
    Development Goals. We are now taking stock of what we can learn from
    that effort. For example we know that the commitment to halve the
    percentage of hungry people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target,
    has been almost met at the global level. Indeed, 73 of the 129
    countries monitored for progress have reached that MDG target, while
    29 of them also reached the more ambitious WFS goal by at least
    halving the number of undernourished people in their populations.

    This year also marks the beginning of the new post-2015 Sustainable
    Development Agenda. Again the international community will unite
    around new priorities for the future.

    Clear indicators to measure progress towards these international
    goals is of paramount importance. Timely and robust statistics are
    the fundamental tool in monitoring the myriad efforts being made,
    both with an eye to early detection of problems and the recognition
    of success. The better the data, the better the policies that can be
    designed. And the better the data, the easier it is to measure the
    impact of policies or to hold stakeholders accountable for the
    pledges they make.

    This publication presents selected key indicators related to
    agriculture and food security that stakeholders can use to
    prioritize their actions. It is divided into two main sections, one
    thematic and one country-specific. It presents a variety of
    dimensions of agriculture and food security along four main focus
    areas:

    {\textbf{\color{part1} The setting}} measures the state of the
    agricultural resource base by assessing the supply of land, labour,
    capital and inputs, and examining the pressure on the world food
    system stemming from demographic and macroeconomic change.

    {\textbf{\color{part2} Hunger dimensions}} gauges the state of
    food insecurity and malnutrition, and highlights the four dimensions
    – availability, access, stability and utilization – that determine
    the scale of hunger and the shape of undernourishment.

    {\textbf{\color{part3} Food supply}} evaluates the past and
    present productive capacity of world agriculture, together with the
    role of trade, in meeting the world’s demand for food, feed and
    other products.

    {\textbf{\color{part4} Environment}} examines the sustainability
    of agriculture in the context of the pressure it exerts on its
    ecological surroundings, including the interaction of agriculture
    with climate change.

    This Pocketbook is part of the FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of
    products and is just one of the tools that can be used as building
    blocks for monitoring progress and formulating policy. It includes
    data from FAOSTAT as well as from other partners within the
    organization and in the international community.

    FAO is deeply committed to helping countries strengthen their
    statistical systems to improve the timeliness and quality of their
    data. And it will continue to do so through the SDG process.

  subtitle: Coffee
  bottom_row1: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

  foreword: |
    Today, more people are consuming more coffee than ever before. As
    the middle classes of the developing world continue to swell, as
    their incomes rise and coffee remains affordable, the luxury of the
    occasional coffee has become a daily habit in an ever-growing number
    of countries. The rising demand has also afforded producers with new
    options and opportunities. Coffee has become an important
    contributor to cash income for many smallholders, who produce most
    of the world’s beans. The annual output has now reached almost nine
    million tonnes, one million tonnes more than a decade ago. The gross
    value of production of green coffee now exceeds US\$16 billion, and
    its export value reached US\$24 billion in 2012.

    \vspace{3mm}

    While rising demand offers unprecedented opportunities to growers,
    they also have to live up to a growing set of challenges. Many are
    confronted with inadequate access to credit, high price volatility,
    as well as bureaucratic hurdles at home and market barriers abroad.
    And, they are operating in a global value chain where a vast and
    often unorganized number of small coffee growers are exposed to the
    market power of a few, large traders and roasters. In addition, many
    smallholders find it hard to cope with the vagaries of weather in
    the short-run and the deteriorating growing conditions brought about
    by climate change over the longer-term.

    \vspace{3mm}

    This Pocketbook puts numbers to these developments, assesses short-
    term changes and long-term trends in production, consumption, trade
    and prices, and provides useful background information on related
    shifts in poverty, health and rural development. It is part of the
    FAO Statistical Yearbook suite of products and is organized around
    two major sections: thematic spreads with data-driven
    visualizations, and comprehensive country and regional profiles.

    \vspace{3mm}

    FAO is strongly committed to helping countries strengthen their
    national statistical systems and improve the timeliness and quality
    of their data. This includes a commitment to improve and broaden the
    information necessary to support evidence-based decision making by
    all stakeholders in the coffee value chain.
